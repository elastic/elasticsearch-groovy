/**
 * {@code GroovyTestSanitizer} sanitizes the existing test infrastructure to work well with the Groovy runtime.

 * <li>Modifies {@link LuceneTestCase} to add Groovy's {@link ClassInfo} type to the list (literally it's a
 * {@code Set}) of types that are ignored during the cleanup process.</li>
 * <li>This also adds the {@code SoftReference} to the list of types are ignored so that we can continue to support
 * the Grails release.</li>
 * </ul>
 * This should be invoked in a {@code static} block of every abstract test that uses the Elasticsearch test framework.
 * Since all tests are expected to extend either {@code ESTestCase} or {@code ESIntegTestCase},
 * {@link AbstractESTestCase} and {@link AbstractESIntegTestCase} exist to do this for you.
 * <pre>
 * static {

 * In particular, this should be done before any test has the chance to run.
